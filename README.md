# Stock-Risk-Return-Analysis

##### Brief Intruduction:
1. Implement CER Model & Single Index Model with Point Estimation &amp; Interval Estimation.  
2. Use Classical method and Non-parametric Bootstrap (Percentile method and T method).  
3. Solve the best portfolio for 2 stocks for minimum variance. 

Data source: Wind

##### Model Explanation

1. CER Model:   
	The CER model assumes that return of an asset over time is independent and identically normally distributed with a constant (time invariant) mean and variance. The model allows for the returns on different assets to be contemporaneously correlated but that the correlations are constant over time.  
2. Single Index Model:
